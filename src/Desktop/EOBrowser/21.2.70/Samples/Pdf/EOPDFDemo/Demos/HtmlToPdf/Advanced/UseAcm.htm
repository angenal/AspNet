        In addition to Html to PDF, EO.Pdf also supports ACM 
        (PDF Creator). ACM provides a set of lower level 
        objects that generally requires more code to create
        the same contents than HTML to PDF but is much faster. 
        You can use both features together. This sample 
        uses HTML to PDF to generate the main content and then
        use ACM to generate the page header.
