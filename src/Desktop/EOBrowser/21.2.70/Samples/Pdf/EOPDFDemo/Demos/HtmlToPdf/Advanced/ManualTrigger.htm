        By default, the HTML to PDF converter automatically starts the 
        conversion as soon as all the contents of the page (such as 
        images) are fully loaded. However, sometimes you may need to 
        perform some additional initialization tasks with JavaScript 
        and the conversion should not start until your initialization 
        code is done. In this case you can 
        <a href="javascript:eo_OpenHelp('HtmlToPdf/eo_js.html#manual_trigger')">manually trigger the conversion</a>
        from JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The following code demonstrates how to use this feature. It
        uses a timer to count from 0 to 100. The conversion is only
        triggered through JavaScript when the counter reaches 100.
        </p>
        <p>
        <textarea id="txtHTML" style="width:100%;height:300px;">
&lt;div id="counter"&gt;
The conversion will not start until counter counts to 100.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var counter = 0;

function increaseCounter()
{
    counter++;
    document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML = counter;
    if (counter == 100)
        eoapi.convert();
    else
        setTimeout("increaseCounter()", 20);
}

increaseCounter();
&lt;/script&gt;
