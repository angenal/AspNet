This sample demonstrates how to create a page header

</p>
<p>
A child <b>AcmRender</b> object is created inside the
root <b>AcmRender</b> object's <b>BeforeRenderPage</b>
event handler to render a context sensitive page header.
Inside the event handler we examine the event argument's
<b>FirstContent</b> and <b>LastContent</b> to determine
what contents are on the current page. We then use the
content's <b>Tag</b> property to derive the current
chapter name. The <b>Tag</b> property is a transparent
property that allows you to associate arbitrary data to
each content.
